# NIAGADS Visualization Toolkit

## Example ReactApp

* until react-tables migration is complete, run `npm install` with the `--legacy-peer-deps` option
* must set environmental variable `NODE_ENV=development` before running `npm start`

## Javascript / React

# Next Steps - Developer notes:

* investigate [tsdx](https://tsdx.io/) as alternative / in addition to next.js to generate the library package
  * can use tailwind (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fh-xdSf9uH0)
  * may need to extract example app out into its own project
